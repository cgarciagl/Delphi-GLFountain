## GLFountain

  This is a little example about particles system.

  Here we use the Direction property of the TGLSphere like
  a motion vector for the movement.

(Iknow i shouldn't put an exe on the repo, but it's for the purpouse that you can test it without having to install Delphi and GLScene ðŸ˜‰)

#Requirements

It requires Delphi and GLScene to compile
